# options (global ruby variables) which are detailed below. To modify
# these options, first copy this file to "config.rb". Then simply
# uncomment the necessary lines, leaving the $, and replace everything
# after the equals sign..

# Change basename of the VM
# The default value is "core", which results in VMs named starting with
# "core-01" through to "core-${num_instances}".

# Change the version of CoreOS to be installed
# To deploy a specific version, simply set $image_version accordingly. 
# For example, to deploy version 709.0.0, set $image_version="709.0.0".
# The default value is "current", which points to the current version
# of the selected channel
#$image_version = "current"
